        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello there and welcome to my clarinet webpage. I have over 28 years of experience teaching private lessons and master classes. I began playing clarinet in the fifth grade and enjoyed it so much that I decided to major in music at Shepherd University (WV) where I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Music Education. After college, I spent 20 years in the Army where I was able to perform in different music groups in 23 countries and 18 states. I have a Master of Education in Instructional Technology from North Carolina State University and will finish my Education Specialist in Learning Technologies and Design at the University of Missouri in 2022. I enjoy finding new ways to integrate technology into my music lessons.</p>
            <p>I am still an active performer and belong to several music groups including the Commonwealth Winds in Richmond, VA. In addition to clarinet, I am proficient on bass clarinet,  saxophone, flute, and oboe.</p>
