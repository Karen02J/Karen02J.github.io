       <h2> Personal Reflection</h2>
            <p>Over the years I have helped hundreds of students to develop their playing skills.  Many have been first chair in their school or were selected for all-county, all-district, or all-state groups.  A few have even gone on to major in music at college.  I have enjoyed watching these students grow as musicians and as people.  It does not matter to me if the student plans to major in music or pursue another profession. What does matter to me is that the student chooses to keep music in their life even after their formal education has ended. So,  I am  always pleased when I hear that a former student continues to play their instrument, either for pleasure or in a local community group.</p>

        <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
            <p class="philosophy1">As a teacher, my goal is to develop each student to their fullest potential as a musician. Each student is a unique individual with different backgrounds, experiences, and goals. It is my job to meet them at their current level and advance their playing skills.  Private lessons allow me to tailor each lesson to the student’s learning style and help them meet their goals and improve their playing. </p>
            <p class="philosophy2">My main focus in developing students is to get them to play with a pleasing tone.  I do this with a series of exercises that I have developed over the years.  I balance my instruction with a focus on fundamentals such as intonation, scales,  rhythm, and sight-reading.  With the individual student in mind, I select a variety of resources to use during the lesson: solos, duets, etudes, listening assignments, and technical exercises.</p>
            <p class="philosophy2">As a way to teach to the individual student, I use technology to enhance the lessons. I believe that technology should not be the main focus or outcome of the lesson, but rather a tool to supplement learning and motivate the student. The technologies I use are free or low-cost, user-friendly, and safe to use.</p>
            <p class="philosophy2">I am very appreciative of the parents who take the time to encourage their student’s musical endeavors. I realize that today’s music students have a lot of demands placed on them in school and in other activities so I will  create a lesson schedule that best benefits the student. My studio offers individual and group lessons and the student and/or parent can choose the frequency of the lessons. I welcome students of all ability levels to my clarinet studio. I send a special invitation to any adult students who would like to learn an instrument.  </p>
