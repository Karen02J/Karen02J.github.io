  My name is Karen Ballengee and I am the Assistant Instructional Technology Specialist at the Virginia Adult Learning Resource Center which is part of Virginia Commonwealth University.  As part of my duties, I update the website, but coding is not my strong point, especially as it pertains to page layout.  I can go in and make small changes to our site, but I feel like I need to keep learning in order to manage larger, more complex websites. I would like to learn more about responsive design and usability.  These are things that I noticed are included in the course syllabus so I am excited.  The usability portion will be a great help as we redesign our website at work. Iâ€™m a retired Army clarinet player so I keep busy by playing woodwind instruments in various music groups in the Richmond area. I also enjoy spoiling my handsome rescue Pomeranian.
